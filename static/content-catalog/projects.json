    "description": "Go Compiler is a procedural programming language with a C-like syntax, designed and built from scratch using Go. It supports core language features such as arrays, loops, functions, and arithmetic operations. Logical operators and ternary expressions provide additional flexibility. The compiler ensures robust type checking and variable declaration validation, with clear error messaging. It translates source code into a simplified RISC instruction set, enabling efficient execution.",
